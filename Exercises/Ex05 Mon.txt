Exercise 1.01 - Describe what a cpu contain
 - Instruction Control Unit
 - Instruction Decode Unit
 - Instruction Execution Unit 
 - Address Generation Units
 - Registers
 - Clock
 - Arithmetic Logic Unit
 - Cache
 - The Bus
 - Floating Points Units 
 - Scheduling Units
 - Instruction Ques

Exercise 1.02 - That is the register Address Counter used for
 Register for storing information about the next address in memory to be executed.

Exercise 1.03 - What is flags?
 Flags are storing the current state of the processor
 - Eg. Scott CPU's ALU had flags to show if inputs was bigger, equal ect...

Exercise 1.04 - Describe the bus?
 The traces where information is transffered around the CPU/Motherboard
 Control Bus - Determines the operation to be carried out.
 Address Bus - Where information should be sent.
 Data Bus - Carries information.

Exercise 1.05 - What is an interrupt vector?
 An interrupt vector is the memory location of an interrupt handler

Exercise 1.06 - Describe ALU?
 It does math and logic. Part of the CPU that is used the most.

Exercise 1.07 - Explaining how at jump if condition works
 Takes 2 inputs to the ALU
 Run comparason
 If a condition (flags) is true, it starts processing a differnt set of instructions in memory

Exercise 3.01 - Describe what an OS architecture is? 
 The Kernal, the core part of the operating system. First layer ontop of the hardware.
 Provides abstraction and arbitration.

Exercise 3.02 - Try to draw your software architecture
 Utilities & Libaries
 Kernal
 Device Drivers | BIOS
 Hardware

Exercise 4.01 - Describe what is a process ? 
 An instance of a computer program, that is being executed.

Exercise 4.02 - Describe what  the states of a process can be in? 
 - New: First called; Program loads; Waiting for PCB to be constructed.
 - Ready: Process is intialized.
 - Run: Gets CPU Time
 - Wait: Waiting for I/O or Resources
 - Terminated: Exists Systems

Exercise 4.03 - Describe what is a PCB?
 Process Control Block
 Is a data structure, that represents a process.
 Contains important information such as:
 - Current State of the process
 - Unique Identifyer
 - A pointer to parents process
 - Pointer to child processes
 - Priority
 - Register save area
 - Processor its running on

Exercise 4.04 - Explain what a Process Scheduler is, and what it does
 Part of the operating system that decides what process runs at certain times, moving the processes between their states
 Decides what should be excetured.

Exercise 4.05 - Describe what happen then the Process Scheduler switch between process A and B?
 Allows a Processor to "multi-task" by taking the state of the running process (A) and storing it in its PCB.
 Then the state is loaded from process B's PCB into the registers, and run.

 TLDR; Stores and restores the states of the different processes. 

Exercise 4.06 - Describe what is a message que and why it is necessary to have one ?
 Nu

Exercise 6.01 - Describe what is a Thread?
 - Comes in 2 variants, User & Kernal Level.
 - Entities schedules for execution on the CPU.
 - A thread is a single set instructions within a Processs
